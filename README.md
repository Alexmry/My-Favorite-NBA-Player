# Feedback For Algolia

I really like Algolia's website but I think it can still be improve:

1. The hyperlinks under the Requirements section in the link below do not work(Error 404)
https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/widgets/refinement-list/js/?client=HTMLElement#about-this-widget. A working link to my Attributes for faceting dashboard or a tutorial video could save Algolia's clients some time. 

2. coming soon
